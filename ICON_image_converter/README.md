## Overview
This Python application provides a graphical interface for converting images between various formats (WEBP, ICO, PNG, JPEG, JPG) with optional resizing and metadata stripping.

## Features
- Convert between WEBP, ICO, PNG, JPEG, and JPG formats
- Resize images with different fit modes (max, crop, scale)
- Option to strip metadata
- Progress bar showing conversion status
- User-friendly Tkinter interface

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later
- Pillow library

## How to Use
1. $\color{red}{\mathrm{Check\ the\ Output\ Format\ FIRST\ Ico,\ Jpeg,\ PNG,\ Jpg,\ Webp }}$    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/773c2889-84f2-4ca8-bb0e-b5e157617c83)

2. Select Input File (If you selected the file first, just select it again after choosing the output format)
3. Choose output location
4. Adjust resize settings if needed (width, height, fit mode)
5. Check "Strip Metadata" if desired
6. Click "Convert"
7. Wait for the progress bar to complete

## Installation Tutorial

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```sh
python -m venv imgconverter-env
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
- **Windows:**
  ```sh
  imgconverter-env\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux:**
  ```sh
  source imgconverter-env/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Requirements
```sh
pip install pillow
```

### 4. Run the Application
```sh
python image_converter.py
```

## Explanation of the Code
We'll focus on the key components that make the converter work:

### Core Conversion Logic
```python
with Image.open(input_path) as img:
    if img.mode not in ('RGB', 'RGBA'):
        img = img.convert('RGB')
    # ... conversion happens here ...
```
### 1. Image Conversion Core
```python
with Image.open(input_path) as img:
    if img.mode not in ('RGB', 'RGBA'):
        img = img.convert('RGB')
    
    # Resizing logic here
    
    output = io.BytesIO()
    if self.output_format.get() == "ico":
        img.save(output, format='ICO', sizes=[(width, height)])
    else:
        img.save(output, format=self.output_format.get())
    
    with open(output_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(output.getvalue())
```
This is the core conversion logic that:
1. Opens the input image
2. Converts to RGB if needed (required for JPEG)
3. Handles resizing based on user settings
4. Saves to the desired format (with special handling for ICO)

### 2. Resizing Methods
Three different resize modes are implemented:

**Max (maintain aspect ratio):**
```python
img.thumbnail((width, height))
```

**Crop (fill area exactly):**
```python
def resize_and_crop(self, img, width, height):
    # Calculate aspect ratios and crop appropriately
    # ...
    return img.resize((width, height), Image.LANCZOS)
```

**Scale (force exact dimensions):**
```python
img = img.resize((width, height), Image.LANCZOS)
```

### 3. Threading for Responsive UI
```python
Thread(target=self.convert_image, args=(...), daemon=True).start()
```
The conversion runs in a separate thread to keep the UI responsive during processing.

### 4. Progress Updates
```python
self.root.after(10, lambda: self.progress.step(30))
```
The progress bar is updated using Tkinter's `after` method to ensure thread-safe UI updates.  

### Resizing Methods
- **Max (maintain aspect ratio):** `img.thumbnail((width, height))`
- **Crop:** Custom `resize_and_crop()` function
- **Scale:** `img.resize((width, height), Image.LANCZOS)`

### GUI Threading
```python
Thread(target=self.convert_image, args=(...), daemon=True).start()
```
Ensures the UI remains responsive during conversion.

## Bonus: Creating an EXE
To create a standalone Windows executable:

1. Install PyInstaller:
```sh
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Generate the EXE:
```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed image_converter.py
```

3. The EXE will be in the `dist` folder.

Note: The EXE will be large (50-100MB) as it includes Python.
